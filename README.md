# example-python-lambda

This is a simple example of some Python3 lambda code. It is intended to be used as a starting point for creating new lambda functions.

## Automated Testing

The repository contains a simple PyTest configuration which can be used to run automated tests against the code. The tests are located in the `tests` directory and can be run using the following command:

`python3 -m pytest`

> :warning: The configuration includes a check for code coverage i.e. how much of the code has been tested. As delivered, this check will fail due to not meeting the required level of coverage.
